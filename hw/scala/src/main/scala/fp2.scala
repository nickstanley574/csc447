/* INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * Complete the exercises below.  For each "EXERCISE" comment, add
 * code immediately below the comment.
 *
 * Please see README.md for instructions, including compilation and testing.
 * 
 * GRADING
 * 
 * 1. Submissions MUST compile using SBT with UNCHANGED configuration and tests with no
 *    compilation errors.  Submissions with compilation errors will receive 0 points.
 *    Note that refactoring the code will cause the tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. You MUST NOT edit the SBT configuration and tests.  Altering it in your submission will
 *    result in 0 points for this assignment.
 *
 * 3. You MUST NOT use while loops or (re)assignment to variables (you can use "val" declarations,
 *    but not "var" declarations).  You must use recursion instead.
 *
 * 4. You may declare auxiliary functions if you like.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * 1. Submit this file on D2L before the deadline.
 *
 * 2. Late submissions will not be permitted because solutions will be discussed in class.

  // EXERCISE 1: complete the following recursive definition of a "map" function
  // for Scala's builtin List type.  You must not use the builtin "map" method.
  // Your implementation of "map" MUST be recursive.
  def map [A,B] (xs:List[A], f:A=>B) : List[B] = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    null
  }

  // EXERCISE 2: complete the following recursive definition of a "filter" function
  // for Scala's builtin List type.  You must not use the builtin "filter" method.
  // Your implementation of "filter" MUST be recursive.
  def filter [A] (xs:List[A], f:A=>Boolean) : List[A] = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    null
  }

  // EXERCISE 3: complete the following recursive definition of an "append" function
  // for Scala's builtin List type.  You must not use the builtin ":::" method.
  // Your implementation of "append" MUST be recursive.
  // HINT: use "::" in the body of the cons-cell case.
  def append [A] (xs:List[A], ys:List[A]) : List[A] = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    null
  }

  // EXERCISE 4: complete the following recursive definition of a "flatten" function
  // for Scala's builtin List type.  You must not use the builtin "flatten" method.
  // Your implementation of "flatten" MUST be recursive.
  // HINT: use either ":::" or your definition of "append" in the body of the cons-cell case.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - flatten (List ((1 to 5).toList, (6 to 10).toList, (11 to 15).toList)) == (1 to 15).toList
  def flatten [A] (xss:List[List[A]]) : List[A] = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    null
  }

  // EXERCISE 5: complete the following recursive definition of a "foldLeft" function
  // for Scala's builtin list type.  You must not use the builtin "foldLeft" method.
  // Your implementation of "foldLeft" MUST be recursive.
  // HINT:   foldLeft (  Nil, e, f) == e
  //         foldLeft (y::ys, e, f) == foldLeft (ys, f (e, y), f)
  def foldLeft [A,B] (xs:List[A], e:B, f:(B,A)=>B) : B = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    e

  // EXERCISE 6: complete the following recursive definition of a "foldRight" function
  // for Scala's builtin list type.  You must not use the builtin "foldRight" method.
  // Your implementation of "foldRight" MUST be recursive.
  // HINT:   foldRight (  Nil, e, f) == e
  //         foldRight (y::ys, e, f) == f (y, foldRight (ys, e, f))
  def foldRight [A,B] (xs:List[A], e:B, f:(A,B)=>B) : B = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    e
  }

  // EXERCISE 7: complete the following definition of a "joinTerminateRight" function
  // to take a list of strings "xs" and concatenate all strings using a string "term"
  // as a terminator (not delimiter) between strings.  You MUST use your foldRight defined above.
  // EXAMPLES: 
  // - joinTerminateRight (Nil, ";") == ""
  // - joinTerminateRight (List ("a"), ";") == "a;"
  // - joinTerminateRight (List ("a","b","c","d"), ";") == "a;b;c;d;"
  def joinTerminateRight (xs : List[String], term : String) : String = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    null
  }

  // EXERCISE 8: complete the following definition of a "joinTerminateLeft" function
  // to take a list of strings "xs" and concatenate all strings using a string "term"
  // as a terminator (not delimiter) between strings.  You MUST use your foldLeft defined above.
  // EXAMPLES:
  // - joinTerminateLeft (Nil, ";") == ""
  // - joinTerminateLeft (List ("a"), ";") == "a;"
  // - joinTerminateLeft (List ("a","b","c","d"), ";") == "a;b;c;d;"
  def joinTerminateLeft (xs : List[String], term : String) : String = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    null
  }

  // EXERCISE 9: complete the following recursive definition of a "firstNumGreaterThan" function
  // to find the first number greater than or equal to "a" in a list of integers "xs".
  // If the list is empty or there is no number greater than or equal to "a",
  // throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException (with no argument).
  // Your implementation of "firstNumGreaterThan" MUST be recursive.
  // EXAMPLES:
  // - firstNumGreaterThan (5, List (4, 6, 8, 5)) == 6
  def firstNumGreaterThan (a : Int, xs : List[Int]) : Int = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    -1
  }

  // EXERCISE 10: complete the following recursive definition of a "firstIndexNumGreaterThan" function
  // to find the index (position) of the first number greater than or equal to "a" in a list of integers "xs".
  // If the list is empty or there is no number greater than or equal to "a", throw a
  // java.util.NoSuchElementException (with no argument).
  // The first index should be zero (not one).
  // Your implementation of "firstIndexNumGreaterThan" MUST be recursive.
  // EXAMPLES:
  // - firstIndexNumGreaterThan (5, List (4, 6, 8, 5)) == 1
  // HINT: this is a bit easier to write if you use an auxiliary function.
  def firstIndexNumGreaterThan (a : Int, xs : List[Int]) : Int = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    -1
  }
